# CS320

This portfolio submission includes files from both Project One and Project Two in the CS 320 course. These projects demonstrate my understanding of software testing, automation, and quality assurance principles. The files included are:
	•	Contact.java
	•	ContactService.java
	•	ContactTest.java
	•	ContactServiceTest.java

These classes show my ability to write object-oriented code, validate inputs, manage data, and test using JUnit. Together, they reflect my progression in developing reliable and functional Java programs using good testing practices.

Throughout this course, I have learned the importance of ensuring that code is both functional and secure. To achieve this, I consistently used input validation, exception handling, and unit testing. For example, in Contact.java, I included logic to check the length and null status of each input. I also used JUnit to test edge cases, such as invalid IDs or names, which helped me catch errors early and improve the reliability of the application.

I also learned how to better interpret user needs by closely following the project requirements and turning them into working features. This meant thinking through how a user might interact with the application and planning tests for both success and failure outcomes. By breaking each feature into smaller tasks and writing clean, readable code, I was able to match user expectations more effectively.

When approaching software design, I learned to start by creating classes with clear responsibilities and testing them individually. I used a modular approach, breaking the program into smaller pieces that were easier to manage and test. Writing test cases helped me understand the flow of my application and gave me more confidence in its stability. Overall, these projects taught me not only how to write code but how to think critically about its structure and purpose.
